There should be clear a statement of the assumption that will happen when we test an experiment. Example of hypothesis: Using Knowledge Graph when adding memory to Lilli prompts will lead to a improvement of XX% in accuracy compared to the current GPT Turbo 3.5 model we currently have on Lilli)

Expected effect (optional): Describe what is the expected outcome of the proposed experiment.

Risky Assumptions to mitigate (optional): Define any risky assumptions we should focus when doing the experiment.

Specific model/framework (optional): Describe any model, frameworks or tools that you want to be tested on this experiment.

Success Metrics: Describe what are the main measurable metrics that will be used to evaluate the outcomes of the experiment. This metrics will be the guide to observe, quantify, and analyze the effects of the experimental interventions we will be running.

Learning goal: Define here what is that your team hope to learn from the experiment.

There should be clear a statement of the assumption that will happen when we test an experiment. Example of hypothesis: Using Knowledge Graph when adding memory to Lilli prompts will lead to a improvement of XX% in accuracy compared to the current GPT Turbo 3.5 model we currently have on Lilli)

Expected effect (optional): Describe what is the expected outcome of the proposed experiment.

Risky Assumptions to mitigate (optional): Define any risky assumptions we should focus when doing the experiment.

Specific model/framework (optional): Describe any model, frameworks or tools that you want to be tested on this experiment.

Success Metrics: Describe what are the main measurable metrics that will be used to evaluate the outcomes of the experiment. This metrics will be the guide to observe, quantify, and analyze the effects of the experimental interventions we will be running.

Learning goal: Define here what is that your team hope to learn from the experiment.

Main hypothesis: Please define the hypothesis (es) that will be tested through the proposed experiment. There should be clear a statement of the assumption that will happen when we test an experiment. Example of hypothesis: Using Knowledge Graph when adding memory to Lilli prompts will lead to a improvement of XX% in accuracy compared to the current GPT Turbo 3.5 model we currently have on Lilli)

Expected effect (optional): Describe what is the expected outcome of the proposed experiment.

Risky Assumptions to mitigate (optional): Define any risky assumptions we should focus when doing the experiment.

Specific model/framework (optional): Describe any model, frameworks or tools that you want to be tested on this experiment.

Success Metrics: Describe what are the main measurable metrics that will be used to evaluate the outcomes of the experiment. This metrics will be the guide to observe, quantify, and analyze the effects of the experimental interventions we will be running.

Learning goal: Define here what is that your team hope to learn from the experiment.
